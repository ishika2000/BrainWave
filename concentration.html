<p>Sukhasana is one of the most basic yoga asanas and is suitable for yogis of all levels. The name is derived from the Sanskrit, sukha, meaning "pleasure" or "comfort," and asana, meaning "pose."</p>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sit erect, with your feet stretched out in front of you.</li>
<li>Now cross your legs such that your knees are wide, shins are crossed, and each foot is placed under the knee. Your knees must be bent, and your legs should be tucked into your torso.</li>
<li>
Your feet must be relaxed, and the outer edges must rest on the floor while the inner edges must arch on your shins. When you look down on your legs, you must see a triangle formed by your shins that are crossed and both your thighs.
Ensure a comfortable space between your pelvis and feet. Your pelvis must be in a neutral position.</li>
<li>
Your back must be balanced in such a way that the tailbone and the pubic bone are at equal distance from the floor.</li>
<li>Now that your feet are in their place, you can place your palms stacked up in your lap. Or you can also lay them on your knees palms up or palms down.</li>
Elongate your tailbone, and firm up your shoulders. But make sure your lower back is not arched such that it pokes the lower ribs forward.</li>
<li>In yoga, they say that if you can sit in a pose for two hours and thirty-two minutes, you have mastered it. You can sit in this pose as long as you are comfortable.</li>
<li>Just make sure that you alternate the crossing of the legs. You can keep your right leg over your left on even days, and the left over the right on odd days.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p>Benefits of sukhasana include opening of the hips and lengthening of the spine. It can also be used to ground the body and open the muladhara (root) chakra. In addition, it is a serene and calming posture that has been described as offering the route to spiritual enlightenment.
To meditate or practice breathing exercises for long periods with this pose, it is important to keep the spine straight and properly aligned</p>
