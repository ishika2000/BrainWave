      <p style="color:white;padding:20px; font-size: 25px;"><strong>Whatever you desire, you can achieve it using Mind Power:</strong>
All physical reality is made up of vibrations of energy; even your thoughts are vibrations of energy. While it sounds like a concept or theory, this is a new reality that quantum physics has revealed to us. Your thoughts have a powerful influence on your life.<br><strong>Your thoughts affect what happens to you:</strong>
Most of us go through life taking little notice of our thought processes: how the mind thinks, what it fears, what it heeds, what it says to itself, what it brushes aside. For the most part, we go about your lives with minimal attention paid to how we think. We go through life neglecting one of the most important and powerful forces in our life: our thoughts.<br>
<strong style="color:#000;">So it is important to know the power of your mind, so that you can use your mind propery and effectively</strong>

    </div>
    <div id="music" class="tab-pane fade" style="background-image:url('background_music.png');background-size:1400px 400px;">
      <p style="color:#000;padding:20px;font-size: 25px;">Music, like the other fine arts, is what feeds the soul and touches the body, moving it. Anyone who has grown up with a musically talented parent knows the tremendous part that music plays in one's memory.  And, anyone who has "been acquainted with the night" as Robert Frost put it, knows and can relate to the Blues. 
Music can fit our moods, as well.  I will always remember riding along with a friend years ago.  This friend loved hard rock, but he had  Johnny Cash's "Sunday Morning Coming Down" playing as I got into the car.  "What is this?" I asked. "You don't ever listen to Country Western; in fact, you loathe it!".Yes, sometimes we are in harmony with what music says and it talks to us, and pulls at our hearts in most unusual ways, nurturing, comforting, commiserating, exhilirating, soothing, strengthening us against the dark.  What would life be like without it?  Terribly cold and silent, indeed.</p>

    <div id="yoga" class="tab-pane fade"style="background-image:url('yogaa.jpg');background-size:cover;">
      <p style="padding:20px;font-size: 25px;">Yoga is not a religion, it is a way of living that aims towards a healthy mind in a healthy body. Man is a physical, mental and spiritual being; yoga helps promote a balanced development of all the three. Other forms of physical exercises, like aerobics, assure only physical well-being.The word 'yoga' is derived from Sanskrit and means 'to join'/to unite'. Yoga exercises have a physical effect and bring a balance between body, soul and mind. Yoga helps us to deal with our problems, worries and everyday demands. It also influences us to understand ourselves, the purpose of life and develops our relationship with God. Yoga leads a spiritual path to knowledge and eternal bliss in the union of eternal self with universal self. Yoga is that supreme and infinite principle. Yoga is that ray of life that is universal cognizant that is awake.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="games" class="tab-pane fade"style="background-image:url('gamess.jpg');background-size:cover;">
      <p style="color:white;padding:20px;font-size: 25px;">Games plays an important role in maintaining a healthy mind, body and soul. Games gives us a lot of exercises in forming our body as well as mind. The improvement of our body and mind keep away diseases. It gives us the ability to take defeat well.

A real sportsman will play a fair game always. He must have a cool and pleasant temper. Games foster a spirit of friendship and co-operation among the players. A sportsman must sacrifice his personal interest for the good of the team and take the game seriously. He will take keen interest to win. When a game becomes a profession, a real work of life, no longer remain a recreation to the players.

Therefore, games should be played for the sake of enjoyment, pleasure and recreation. If played in the right spirit, games become an important part of life - a better and healthy life.</p>

<div id="Motivation" class="tab-pane fade"style="background-image:url('motivateee.jpg');background-size:cover;">
      <p style="padding:20px;font-size: 25px;">Motivation is important for everyone. Motivation is important to live. We can't live our daily life happily without motivation. Motivation is the presence of purpose and desire to achieve daily life, career, and business goals. Just an example, Motivation helps us to get up early and become productive.
When we are inspired, excited, getting more than expected results from something we get motivated. Such as its inspiring when you read stories and beliefs of successful people. It's inspiring when you see someone achieving something great and feeling happy. That's the way we feel motivated and it helps us to achieve our own goals.There are thousands of motivations around us. Such as motivation from books, motivation from quotes, motivation from the seminar, motivation from water, motivation from trees, motivation from kids, motivation from parents, motivation from teachers etc. But we can't identify all of them.</p>
