<p>Dhanurasana or the Bow Pose is one of the 12 basic Hatha Yoga poses. It is also one of the three main back stretching exercises. It gives the entire back a good stretch, thus imparting flexibility as well as strength to the back.
Dhanurasana is a backbend that deeply opens the chest and the front of the body. The name comes from the Sanskrit dhanu, meaning "bow," and asana, meaning "pose."</p>
<h3>Variation</h3>
<p>In this asana, the practitioner lies flat on the stomach and bends the knees. Then the arms reach back to grab the ankles. The back arches and the thighs lift off of the floor as the chest pushes forward, bending the body to resemble a bow.

Dhanurasana is commonly referred to as bow pose in English. 
</p>
<h3> Benefits</h3>
<p>Dhanurasana (DAH-noo-RAH-suh-nuh) is an excellent back bending yoga pose for increasing and regaining spinal strength and flexibility. It invigorates the internal organs, especially the digestive organs, therefore removing constipation. It also stimulates the adrenal glands and the sympathetic nervous system. This pose expands the chest and strengthens the lungs, making it a good pose for those with asthma and respiratory problems. Dhanurasana also strengthens the leg muscles, especially the upper thighs, relieves stiff shoulders and reduces excess weight around the abdominal area. This pose is recommended for those with diabetes, incontinence and menstrual disorder.</p>
<h3>Caution</h3>
<p>Avoid this pose when you have a headache or migraine. Women who are menstruating or pregnant should avoid this pose. Those with neck injuries or pain should keep the head up right. This pose should not be done when suffering from any stomach ulcer or diarrhea. Make sure students continue normal breathing and do not hold their breath in this pose as this can result in heaviness in the head. Keep the legs and arms firm to avoid any load bearing directly on the spine.</p>
