  <p>Jala basti is a Hatha yoga technique in which water is sucked into the anus with or without the use of a catheter tube for the purpose of cleansing the colon. The term is derived from the Sanskrit, jala, meaning “water,” and basti, which refers to the abdominal region.One of two types of basti, jala basti is a difficult technique that involves pulling the abdomen in and up. The other type of basti, sthala basti, involves cleansing the colon by sucking air into the body without a tube, but still using a technique similar to jala basti.</p>

  <p>Basti is one of the six techniques that comprise shatkarma (also called shatkriya), the yogic body cleansing system. It is used in the traditional Indian medicine practice of Ayurveda. Jala basti is believed to remove toxins and cool the body by cleaning the bowel and removing old stool, excess bacteria, and thread worms from the lower intestines.To successfully practice jala basti, a yogi must first master uddiyana bandha (the abdominal lock), nauli (internal massage of the abdominal region) and ashwini mudra (a rhythmic contraction of the anal sphincter).</p>
  <p>Jala basti is thought to have the following additional health benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improves abdominal muscle tone</li>
  <li>Treats digestive disorders such as constipation and nervous diarrhea</li>
  <li>Strengthens the solar plexus</li>
  <li>Purifies the blood</li>
</ul>
<p>Yogis who have high blood pressure, a hernia or a serious digestive disorder should not practice jala basti. Those who suffer from colitis or dysentery may benefit from jala basti, but should seek a doctor's approval first.</p>

  <h1>Sthula Basti kriya</h1><br>

      <p>Sthala basti is a Hatha yoga cleansing technique that targets the colon by sucking air into the body through the anus. It is a difficult technique that involves pulling the abdomen in and up.
      Sthala basti can be performed in different postures, including utkatasana and ardha paschimottanasana, but a supine position is recommended for beginners.</p>

      <p>Sthala basti improves digestion by relieving gas from the colon. Because poor digestion leads to other problems, sthala basti can help prevent headaches, improve concentration and promote an overall feeling of well-being.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
      Sthala or dry basti is performed while lying on the back. Assume Vipareeta karani mudra but position the back at a 60° angle to the floor.</li>
      <li> Then bring the knees down to the chest. Push the sphincter muscles out and in, so air is sucked into the bowel.</li>
      <li>Sthala basti can also be practised in pashinee mudra or paschimottanasana, performing ashwini mudra. Uddiyana may also be required in the beginning.</li>
      <li> In paschimottanasana it is not easy to suck in air as there is pressure on the anus, so it is best to start in an inverted asana. The 'Hatharatnavali' says "After practising basti, do not take food for three ghatis (72 minutes).'</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Basti completely washes the bowel and removes excess bacteria, old stool, thread worms and heat from the lower intestines. Most importantly, it pushes apana vayu upward. When the apana, rises it can be felt in the navel and as a great pressure on the stomach. Basti cures digestive disorders and is particularly useful for removing constipation, controlling nervous diarrhoea and strengthening the solar plexus. It also improves muscle tone and blood supply as well as purifying the blood.</p>

     <p> Do not deliberate on this practice and think of it as disgusting. A common mistake most yoga beginners make. Such thoughts can prevent your body from appropriately vomiting. Think of this kriya as a fast cleansing practice. Within a few minutes, it provides relief from stomach pain and makes you feel light in the chest and stomach.</p>
<p>Do not worry if all the water you drank did not come out again. Try to get out all the water as much as possible and even if the remaining water goes down; it is okay. This water gets eliminated naturally. Do not worry about it. Just like any other practice, this Kriya will need some practice.
Yogendra Vamandhauti; stomach wash (gastric autolavage).  It is a simple and safe technique for maintaining proper hygiene of the alimentary canal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Boil 1 litre of drinking water and let it cool till lukewarm.</li>
<li>Add one tablespoon each of salt and soda bicarbonate in equal proportions and stir well.</li>

<li>Stand or sit comfortably (sit in a squatting position, if comfortable).</li>
<li>Keep drinking this mixture until the stomach can contain it no more. Retain the water; do not throw out immediately.
Exhale entirely and draw the belly in, deep towards the spine.</li>
<li>After 5-10 seconds (as per individual comfort), relax the abdomen and inhale well, letting the stomach balloon. Keep repeating 5 to 10 times, as convenient.</li>
<li>Now apply slight pressure on the pit of the stomach with the palm and vomit the water out. If unable to vomit, insert the forefinger and touch the palate or the root of the tongue.</li>
<li>Rest for a few seconds and repeat step5, above. Keep doing till all the water comes out. Avoid strain and exhaustion.</li>

  <p>Jal Neti is a technique that was used by yogis to stay disease-free, and most importantly to use the breath well for their yogic practices without any blockages. Just how brushing the teeth is dental hygiene, the practice of Jal Neti is nasal hygiene. This technique uses water to purify and clean the nasal path, right from the nostrils to the throat.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The nose should be dried properly after the process.</li>
<li>People with high blood pressure should be careful during this part. If one feels dizzy while drying the nose, then it should be done standing upright.</li>
<li>Take care that you do not leave any water in the nasal passages as it might cause an infection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jal Neti goes beyond nasal cleansing and helps in aligning your body, mind, and soul. Hence, it should be practiced daily and not only when one has a nasal blockage or cold.</p>
<ul>

<li>It soothes the sensitive tissues inside the nose, which can assuage a bout of rhinitis or allergies
-It is beneficial in dealing with asthmatic conditions and making breathing easier.</li>
<li>It reduces tinnitus and middle ear infections.</li>
<li>It helps abate sinusitis or migraine attack.</li>
<li>It can alleviate upper respiratory complaints like sore throats, tonsils, and dry coughs.</li>
<li>It can clear the eye ducts and improve vision.</li>

  <h1>Sutra-Neti</h1><br>

    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p>Sutra Neti is a Hatha yoga technique to clean your nasal cavity. Sutra Neti is one of the six methods of purification or Shatkarma as given in the yogic text Hatha Yoga Pradeepika. There are various types of Neti practiced by Yogis including Jala Neti (with water), Dughda Neti (with Milk), Sutra Neti (with cotton string), etc. In Sutra Neti, a waxed cotton string is traditionally used to clean the nasal cavity.</p>
      <p>Sutra Neti should be learned from a qualified yoga instructor as it needs guidance in the beginning. This practice is ideally done in the early morning after brushing your teeth, though it can be practiced at any time of the day. Acquire a rubber catheter of size between 1 mm and 3 mm from any medical store. Select a size which you feel is comfortable for you to use, through trial and error or through expert advice.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Take the rubber catheter in your hand and very gently insert the tube inside your left nostril. Take care not to rush it; do it very slowly as it can irritate the sensitive membrane inside the nostril. Many people have mild nasal septal deviations, which is more or less harmless. If the deviation is acute then one may feel a block while inserting the rubber tube. Seek expert guidance in such cases.</li>
<li>Push the tube into your nostril upwards, till it hits the back of the throat. At this point the tube will bend and go down the throat. Continue inserting the catheter slowly.</li>
<li>Open your mouth and use your middle and index fingers to grab the tube from inside your throat. This takes a little practice. Once you get the knack of it, you can do it with ease.</li>
<li>Pull the tube out so that part of it is just outside the mouth. Never leave the other end of the tube, which you are holding with your other hand.</li>
<li>Now using both hands move the tube in a massaging motion to clean the nostrils and throat.
Repeat the procedure with the right nostril.</li>
<li>After the practice is over, remove the catheter and clean it. Store the catheter in a clean place for another day’s next practice.</li>
</ul>

  <h1>Trataka</h1><br>

    </div>
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p>Trāṭaka is a method of meditation that involves staring at a single point such as a small object, black dot or candle flame. It is said to bring energy to the "third eye" (ājňā chakra) and promote various psychic abilities.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Sit in meditation pose in front of a candle. Place the candle about an arm’s length away from you with the wick of the candle at the same height as your chest. If the candle is placed too high, it can create tension at the eyebrow centre, or produce a burning sensation in the eyes. The flame should be still and not moving in a draft. Close your eyes. Mentally repeat your Mantra as in meditation.</li>

<li>Open the eyes and look at the flame without blinking. The flame has three zones of colour. At the base of the wick is a reddish colour, in the middle it is bright white and at the tip it is slightly smoky. Concentrate on the upper part of the flame where it is brightest.</li>

<li>Close the eyes again. If the image of the flame appears within, gently concentrate on that image without creating any tension. Try not to pursue or hold onto the image, otherwise it will fade and disappear.
Repeat the practice 3 times.</li>

<li>The practice time should gradually build. In the initial stages, look at the flame only for about 10-15 seconds. Slowly increase this time, so that after about one year you can look at the flame for 1 minute and then concentrate on the inner image with closed eyes for about 4 minutes. Under no circumstances should this recommended length of time be exceeded.</li>

<li>One may also practice Trataka while looking at a white point on black paper, or at a black point on white paper. When one concentrates on a white point, one sees this as a black image when the eyes are closed and vice versa with a black point.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Benifits: </b>Purifies the eyes, strengthens the eye muscles and improves vision and memory. Helps with sleeping difficulties and bedwetting. Strengthens the ability to concentrate and is therefore recommended for school children. Develops intuition, the ability to visualise and willpower.</p>

<p><b>Caution: </b>
This exercise is not suitable for people with psychic problems. Those who have a tendency towards Schizophrenia or hallucinations should not practice Trataka.</p>

  <h1>Nauli Kriya</h1><br>

    </div>
    <div class="col-md-9">
      <p>Nauli kryia is a yogic cleansing exercise that involves a rolling movement of the abdominal muscles. It is an advanced technique that is believed to cleanse the internal organs, particularly the digestive organs and small intestines, and tones the core muscles.</p>
      <p>Massage is used to help heal the body, making the muscles loose and stress free, but is also a useful tool for decreasing mental stress. In most styles of massage we generally work on the muscles, ligaments and the tendons, even when we do self massage we generally rub or apply a gentle pressure on the affected area. This helps to increase the blood flow accelerating the healing process. In Nauli Kriya we create a churning action which helps us to massage our internal organs increasing the blood flow and promoting a healthy digestive system. Nauli is a difficult process which may take some time to master. To prepare our body for Nauli first practice Udiyana Bandha Kriya and Agnisar Kriya.</p>

<p><b>Nauli can be broken down into three parts: </b>
Madhyama (central) nauli, Dakshina (right) nauli and Vama (left) nauli.</p>

<p>The body position is the same as mentioned in the Uddiyana Bandha and Agnisar Kriya. Nauli will happen once you get some control over the oblique muscles. Once you get the Madhyama nauli getting Vama and Dakshina nauli will be easier.</p>
